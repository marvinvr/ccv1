ccv1: Deep Learning - Was versteckt sich da?
==============================
`Patrick Schürmann, Luca Mazzotta & Marvin von Rappard`

This project contains our submission for the ccv1 course at University of Applied Sciences in Brugg. The goal of this project is to classify images from camera traps in the Taï National Park. The results will be submitted to the [DrivenData Competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/page/409/).
